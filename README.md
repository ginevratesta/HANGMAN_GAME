# Hangman Game Project

This Hangman Game project was created for learning purposes by someone who is still in the process of learning web development. The project structure and code were inspired by the tutorial provided by [CodingNepal](https://www.youtube.com/@CodingNepal) on YouTube.

## Overview

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a word by suggesting letters. The game features a simple and interactive web interface.

## How to Play

1. When you open the game, a random word is selected from a predefined list.
2. You can guess letters by clicking on the on-screen keyboard.
3. The game provides a hint for the selected word.
4. The hangman image is displayed, indicating the number of incorrect guesses allowed (up to 6).
5. If a guessed letter is correct, it is revealed in the word display.
6. Incorrect guesses result in the progression of the hangman image.
7. The game ends when either the correct word is guessed or the maximum number of incorrect guesses is reached.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the game.
- `style.css`: The CSS file providing the styling for the game interface.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic for the Hangman game.
- `assets/`: Directory containing images and gifs used in the game.
